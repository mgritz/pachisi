# Pachisi

This is my take on a simple bot opponent for the German board game
"Mensch Ã¤rgere dich nicht" which is a descendant of the ancient middle-eastern game Pachisi.

My goal is to write some sort of automatic opponent for this game in order to practice python and statistical game tree analysis.

First I'll make some framing around for debugging purposes.
Then there will be computer opponents automatically competing to find a statistically optimal strategy.
